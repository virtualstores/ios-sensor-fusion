## Style Guide

Following our style guide should:

* Make it easier to read and begin understanding the unfamiliar code.
* Make code easier to maintain.
* Reduce simple programmer errors.
* Reduce cognitive load while coding.
* Keep discussions on diffs focused on the code's logic rather than its style.

*Note that brevity is not a primary goal.*
